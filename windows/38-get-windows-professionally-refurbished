Sometimes over time windows can become loose and cause heat loss by air movement through the frames.  Correcting this is often more important than changing the glazing.

For older sash and case windows without trickle vents, keep in mind that a little air movement is good for ventilation and for preserving the windows against condensation.  If you do need draughtproofing, brush strips last longer and work better than foam.  Since they are inserted into a channel cut into the wood, if your window frames are very thin this could weaken them too much.   Under some circumstances you may be required to have trickle vents installed.

Other windows are draughtproofed by making the opening part of the window push against a rubber seal.  This can be done as a DIY job but it can be hard to find the best materials for it and professionals are likely to be able to get a better finish.
