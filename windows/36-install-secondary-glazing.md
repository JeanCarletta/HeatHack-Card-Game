Secondary glazing can be a very good option in some buildings, especially if changes to the original glazing are not allowed.  It has the advantage of improving the window draughtproofing - in some installations ventilation in winter can be supplied just by opening the secondary glazing a crack.   It's generally cheaper than double glazing but perhaps half as effective.  A lot depends on how well the windows fit and the distance between the panes. 12mm is the ideal for heat loss, although a bigger distance is better for noise reductioh. 

If you have stained glass, you have to worry about ventilation around the window - condensation will leach the chemicals out of the glass and ruin the colours.   There was a spate of damage to stained glass windows in the 1980s from interior installations and it isn't clear anyone knows what good installation practice requires, so conservationists don't like this.  Because of this, for stained glass, secondary glazing goes on the **outside** of the window and has to be well-spaced, with a big gap for airflow.  This of course reduces its effectiveness.   Where it is allowed, it's because the location isn't very high profile and the glazing means the difference between a building that's usable and one that could become disused or abandoned, placing it at even greater risk.  Because vandalism is a big risk for stained glass, conservationists are likely to refuse requests and propose metal grilles, especially if they don't know why you're asking.  These do nothing for heat loss or noise reduction.
