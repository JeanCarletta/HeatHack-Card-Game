We weren't sure whether to include this card. The "embodied carbon" of making new appliances is a good reason to not to buy them, but there sometimes be appliances that are wasting so much energy they should be replaced.  This is more likely to be the case for very old electrics and ones in bad shape, although even so sometimes they can be repaired instead.  Replacing worn door seals on refrigerators and ovens, for instance, can improve their efficiency cheaply.  

If you have to replace something, it's useful to consider the energy efficiency ratings of your options as well as whether they can be repaired or recycled.
