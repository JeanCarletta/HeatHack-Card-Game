It’s fairly common to install more space heating in a room than needed, “just in case”.  Closing the valves on a radiator, removing an electric heater, or restricting the output can all help groups not overheat a space.  

In the “technical extras” section of the reading materials, we intend to provide a rule of thumb for knowing how much heat output a given space requires.
