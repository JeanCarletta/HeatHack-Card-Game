What to do for this card depends on whether you have a hot water cylinder (storage tank) or something that supplies hot water on demand - either a combi-boiler or a point-of-service hot water heater. 

Hot water cylinders have to be kept above 60C to deter Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaire's disease.  This means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C, or above that if you need it higher for your radiators.

If the hot water isn't being stored, then you can set the hot water for whatever temperature feels right at the taps.  Combi-boilers have a separate dial for this and some manufacturers recommend 50C as a good starting point.
