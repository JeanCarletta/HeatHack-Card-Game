The traditional approach to zoning involves motorised valves that open and close to control the supply of hot water to different circuits in the building.   In a house, that might put the bedrooms on a different circuit that is heated to a different schedule and a lower temperature than the main rooms.  

There are other solutions that are cheaper and much less disruptive to fit because they never require changes to the pipework.  For instance, there are thermostatic radiator valves that you programme at the radiator.  That’s a pain because it involves using a small screen down near the floor on every radiator, but it’s useful for some venues. There are also “smart TRVs” where you tell an app which radiators are in which rooms and then program each room independently.  These systems save less energy than full zoning because the system still needs to send hot water around all the circuits, but it's a much easier change.

Electric heating usually has a switch per room or per radiator already, although occasionally we run into electric heating in a big space that could also be “zoned”, so that if a space is only partly occupied some of the radiators can be left off.
