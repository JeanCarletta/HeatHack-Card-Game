Heating controls in community buildings often waste a lot of energy.  Often they allow users to do things that will use energy beyond what they need to make themselves more comfortable – for instance, by turning on the heating permanently until someone else turns it off.  Ideally, they should only let the users change the heating for a limited time or until the next setting, rather than change a thermostat setting permanently. Sometimes they are just too difficult for users to understand, so they bring in space heaters.  Understanding what is best for how you use your building is a key part of session 3.  

If you are using an old, analogue thermostat, just switching to a digital one will help some.  They are more accurate and make users more comfortable by keeping the temperature from varying too much, so they will often allow you to set the temperature a little lower. 


Even if you have controls that suit your users, outdated controls can still waste energy because of how they control the boiler.  Modern controls can:

- predict when to turn the heating on to get a space to a given temperature by a given time, taking away the need to guess and change the timings when the weather changes. This is usually called "optimum start control". One big benefit of having it is that you can specify different temperatures at different times, making it cooler for people who are physically active.
- vary their output so they put out less heat when it's warm outside.  This is called "weather compensation". 
- put out less heat when the building is close to the target temperature, to avoid overshooting.  This is called "load compensation".

Controls designed for houses rarely limit the temperature range, although sometimes there are hidden settings that will, for instance, restrict the top temperature to the value you specify.  It's also relatively hard to find models that allow users to make temporary changes - essential for keeping them happy - but not permanent ones.  Where this exists, it's usually described as a "lock" that you have to overcome to make permanent changes.  It is more common in controls designed for social housing.

Controls change all the time.  "Smart" TRVs are now available that can be programmed separately via an app but still let the user make some changes at the radiator.   We expect these to be very useful for community buildings with lots of rooms that aren't all always in use, but you need to be careful to understand what they do and don't allow.  The more appropriate ones for community buildings have "zonal controls" with heating schedules for each zone rather than sensing whether the room is occupied.   

Boilers that use the "OpenTherm" standard can be matched to a range of controls, but sometimes it's necessary to use controls from the boiler's manufacturer.

<!-- :TODO:https://www.electricradiatorsdirect.co.uk/news/lot-20-explained-what-does-this-mean-for-electric-heating/ if a site has convective electric heating just with rocker switches, what can they do besides add countdown timers - is there any external control that can be wired in to control them better, or is the only way to improve efficiency to replace them with Lot-20 compliant controls? -->
