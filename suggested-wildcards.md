# Suggested wildcards

Here are some wildcards that have been suggested by our groups.

- **Build a buggy park.** This group observed major heat loss in their large hall whenever groups serving young children entered and exited despite having a draught lobby.  This was because in practice, both ends of the draught lobby had to be open for buggies to pass through so they could be stored safely in the hall itself.  A buggy park would mean less heat was lost, reduce the cleaning bills, and make the heated space available for children to play.
 

 - **Change the batteries on your wireless thermostat.** It can be hard for venues to notice dead batteries (or broken parts) in a wireless thermostat.  Some of the systems will behave wastefully  if the thermostat won't communicate with the boiler. For instance, if the thermostat is also used to programme the heating timings, when it's out of touch the boiler might be brought on either for a default pattern (9-5) or 24/7.  It may be worth proactively changing the batteries before they run out of charge by including this on the venue's annual/bi-annual maintenance plan.
