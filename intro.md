# Introduction  

This activity will  help groups explore a wide range of possible future measures that will improve the value they get from their energy use. The goal of the game is to help groups develop a shared understanding of what's right for their buildings and to choose a set of specific actions to explore and potentially build into their planning.  This makes it very different from, for instance, an energy efficiency survey.  It's not possible for us to suggest which actions will have the biggest effect for any specific building, and in some ways, that's not the point.  Often what keeps groups from acting is uncertainty about what it will be like to make a change - what it takes to insulate a floor, for instance.  The cards are intended to flush out information about likely problem areas from people who know the building, uncover barriers to change, and show where the group's enthusiasm lies.

We call this a cooperative game, but there is no performance measurement - no one wins or loses (not even the whole group). This document explains how to use the cards and also gives explanations and further links for each of the cards in the set.  It's hard to explain some of the suggestions without linking to material from specific manufacturers.  Our links should not be taken to imply that we are endorsing any particular product or that it is the "best".  They are only meant to be illustrative.

We post cards to the groups participating in our programme, but if you need them electronically, or need a PDF of this website, you can find them on our Google Drive:

We are also still researching good practical and technical links to include and finding case studies for the larger changes.  The last section mentions some changes we think we should make.  If you know something that would improve the game, please tell us!
