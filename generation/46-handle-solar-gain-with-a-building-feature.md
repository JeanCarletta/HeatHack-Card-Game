 Sometimes it is possible to modify existing buildings to make better use of the sun.  That might be a glass structure outside the building that will trap heat to warm the building, and possibly also act as a draught lobby.  It could also be something that shades an area that's too hot, for instance, an overhang at the right angle to let in the sun in the winter but not in the summer.
