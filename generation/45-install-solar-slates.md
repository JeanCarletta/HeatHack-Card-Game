 Generation technology is starting to be integrated straight into slates that can be made integral to your roof.  They’re shinier than normal slates, but Historic Environment Scotland has commented that they are perfectly acceptable on some listed buildings, as long as there’s nothing particularly special about the roof.  It’s hard to know whether to recommend them.  Like most new technologies, they have a reputation for teething problems.  In this case, it’s water ingress. Some countries have better technology than others, and we don’t know the situation in the UK.   If you think you may need to replace your roof at some point anyway, this is definitely a technology to watch.
