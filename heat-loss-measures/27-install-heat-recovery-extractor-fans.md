Extractor fans are necessary in some spaces to remove moist or stale air, but they also cause heat loss.  It's possible to get extractor fans that recover the heat and put it back into the building by transferring it to fresh air from outside.  The more the extractor is on, the more useful this card will be.

Extractors can come on and go off with the lights, come on with the lights but run longer, work from a pull cord, or run automatically based on the relative humidity.  The right choice depends on the application.
