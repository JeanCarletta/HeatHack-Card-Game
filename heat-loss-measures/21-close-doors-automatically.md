Sometimes there are doors that users tend to leave open between spaces at different temperatures.  Sometimes closing them automatically will help, either using a cheap hydraulic door closer.  Before you do this, consider why they leave it open.  If it's just forgetfulness, a door closer is a good idea.  If there's some underlying reason, you could just spend money only for them to then block the door open with the nearest fire extinguisher.
