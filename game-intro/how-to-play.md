# How to use the cards

We don't want to be prescriptive about how the cards are used because we've never done this before.  The one thing we're sure of is that no one person should take the card set away and come back with "the solution" as a fait accompli!  There won't be time in the session to use every card or to discuss these things fully - the facilitator needs to keep things moving.  The goal is to get a sense of how this works and start the process of understanding what might be "on the cards" for the group. 

Since not all actions apply to all buildings, a good first step might be scattering the cards on a table and let people spot and suggest cards that can be put aside.  For instance, it's easy to decide to remove actions about hot water tanks if there are none.

You might then want to go around the room each choosing a card that might be interesting so that the engineer, with the aide of the card explanations, can tell the group a little more about what the card means and to decide what to do with it by asking the following questions:  

1. Is this action definitely not for us?
2. Is it something we think the community could get behind?
3. Do we need more information before we know whether this is a good thing to do?

The group leader should keep an eye on the card choices and encourage the group to mix it up - varying the categories, cost, and carbon savings so they don't get fixated on one area. 

The group should save some time at the end to discuss what to do about cards where they need more information.  That might be information about the building and its use, about whether the action is suitable, what it might cost and how it might be funded, or what kind of people would need to be involved, including workers and professionals to ensure correct choices are made, oversee  works, or both.  It's hard to know how long to recommend for this, but groups should at least get a flavour of the process.  

It's good to place the cards they've looked at in different areas on the table, labelled for what that area means.  A good way to record what happens is to photograph the table afterwards.   If everyone has a pen and post-it notes, they can write comments on the items without slowing down the game.
