# Suggested wildcards

Here are some wildcards that have been suggested by our groups.

- **Build a buggy park.** This group observed major heat loss in their large hall whenever groups serving young children entered and exited despite having a draught lobby.  This was because in practice, both ends of the draught lobby had to be open for buggies to pass through so they could be stored safely in the hall itself.  A buggy park would mean less heat was lost, reduce the cleaning bills, and make the heated space available for children to play.
