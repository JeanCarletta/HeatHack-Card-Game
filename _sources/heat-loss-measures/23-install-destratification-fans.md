We weren't sure whether to include this card or not.  In theory, if you have high ceilings and the air is a lot warmer at ceiling level than where people are, destratification fans are useful for pushing the warm air down.  They work well in places like warehouses or spaces where people are active.  They are much less popular in spaces where people are sedentary, because even a relatively warm draught will make people feel colder.  They can also be noisy.  However, in spaces that take a long time to warm up for relatively brief events, like church services, they could be used just during the pre-heat period and turned off when people come in.  

If you're considering this action, you definitely want to check how warm the air at ceiling level is first.  We've sometimes done this in churches using miniature monitors mounted on helium balloon clusters.  For lower ceilings  we've heard of people checking it using normal thermometers on a long pole.
