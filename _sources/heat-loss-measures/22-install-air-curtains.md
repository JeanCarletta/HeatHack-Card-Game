An air curtain is a fan-powered device that blows a jet of warm or room  temperature air over an open doorway.  It blocks cold air on one side from moving into a heated space. They have to be powerful and the full width of the door to work. They usually let you vary the air temperature and fan speed so you can find the lowest settings that will work.  Air curtains struggle with wind, so they’re better on inner doors of vestibules than on external ones.  Some places have to keep doors wide open, but in community buildings, this would be an expensive way to block cold air compared to a draught lobby or doors that close automatically.

We've never seen a proper "air curtain" in a community building.  Usually what we see are just over-door heaters that cheer up anyone standing in the doorway.  These will cost energy, not save it.
