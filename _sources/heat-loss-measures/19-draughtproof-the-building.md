If you draughtproof your building, be careful not to block up any intentional ventilation, because this could make it damp.  

We have a separate card about windows because that's often a more involved job.

You can do a rough test for speed of air movement using a candle.  

On external doors or ones between rooms at very different temperatures, think about the gap at the bottom, any letterbox, the keyhole, and gaps around the door.  You may not be able to draughtproof fire doors or some doors in listed buildings.  

Chimneys can have their airflow reduced with a chimney balloon, chimney cap, or a board covering the hearth, but they do need some airflow to avoid damp.

Loft hatches, the locations of previous extractor fans, and gaps around pipework often get overlooked. Gaps in floorboards and under skirting boards can also be worth addressing.
