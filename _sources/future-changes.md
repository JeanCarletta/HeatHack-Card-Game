# Future changes to the game

We intend the following changes in next version of the game:

- Move the destratification fan card to "actions we've excluded".  Science-minded people can find the idea very attractive and we think it's always likely to be a distraction.

- Add a card for "Have a five-year maintenance plan" that separates out urgent maintenance for this year, mid priority, and longer term actions.  In the church community, conservation architects produce 'quinquennial reports' that provide this plan, but other kinds of organisations might not have them.  Following a plan will minimise expensive damage to the building, make it possible to improve the building instead of making emergency like-for-like replacements, and keep you from wasting money putting scaffolding in the same area twice.  Lots of other cards, like "Keep the building dry", are related so we have to think about whether we need to change those cards if we add this.

- Actions that reduce energy demand are the most important and easiest to do first; after that comes fabric changes to reduce heat loss, then changes to the heating system, and finally, generating energy.  We are considering how we can steer groups into having the right priorities.  This will either be instruction for the volunteer engineer leading the game or a change to the card markings.
