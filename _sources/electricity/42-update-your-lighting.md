If you already have all-LED lighting, you’re fine.  New generation LEDs do use about half the electricity of older ones, but in most cases, a change won’t pay back.   Of course, when replacing LEDs whose quality has degraded, it makes sense to go for the most efficient option you can find.   

If you still have any fluorescent lighting, you’ll want to replace it urgently as you won’t be able to get fluorescent lamps or tubes after September 2023.  

Some venues still have high pressure sodium (HPS) lighting.  LEDs use 40-75% of the energy of HPS – the higher the wattage, the bigger the savings – and provide a better light quality.  

With either fluorescents or HPS, sometimes the right change is to put retrofit LEDs into the same luminaires as the old lamps.  Sometimes you'll need to change the luminaires instead or switch to LED floodlights.
