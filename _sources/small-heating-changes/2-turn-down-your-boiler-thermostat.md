If you have a condensing boiler,  then it can recover heat from the hot gases that result from burning gas or oil, but this will only work if you run the boiler temperature low enough.   
  
Before condensing boilers, boilers were intended to run at a flow temperature of 70-80C, and many of them are still set this way.  Condensing boilers can't recover heat unless the flow temperatuare is around 70C or below.  The lower the flow temperature (down to 45C), the better the heat recovery works. 


 ```{admonition} Safety
:class: warning

If you use a hot water storage tank, you need to keep the flow temperature 70C or above to avoid Legionella.  The tank needs temperatures above 60C to kill the bacteria, and there is some heat loss between the boiler and the tank.

 Whether you can get adequate heat out of the system at, say, 60C – what’s starting to be labelled as “economy” on boilers -  depends.  Lower temperatures are more likely work with generously sized radiators, well insulated buildings, and buildings in high use.  Fan convectors usually require higher flow temperatures – this will be specified in the manual.  
 
```{admonition} Is it a condensing boiler?
:class: tip
Condensing boilers have a small white plastic condensate pipe coming out of them, usually at the bottom.  All boilers installed since 2005 are condensing.

<!--Consider adding boiler modification for hot water.  We’ve read that it’s possible to modify a boiler so it raises the flow temperature only when it’s filling the tank, but it’s less certain that would pay back. -->
