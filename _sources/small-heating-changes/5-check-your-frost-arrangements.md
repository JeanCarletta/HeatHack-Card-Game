It’s expensive and bad for the planet if you get frost damage to your heating system or your building that means you have to replace parts, or damage to timber, furnishings, and items like stained glass windows from condensation.  Protecting the building and its contents is important, but often community building operators go about it the wrong way.  

It's fairly common to see community buildings where the heating comes on for an hour or two a day whether they are occupied or not, "to preserve the building".  This is very expensive.   Instead, you'll want to agree a minimum "setback" temperature for the building and install controls that will enforce it.  This comes as a feature on many heating controls.



You also need frost arrangements to protect wet heating systems.  Some boilers will protect themselves by coming on gently if the water in the boiler drops to 5C.  They won't necessarily protect the rest of the pipework.  Insulation can help with that.  Some older boilers have a similar frost protection mode but require it to be started manually.  

If the boiler doesn't provide the right protection and your only option is to bring the heating on as if there were people in the building, it will be very expensive during extended cold spells.  To reduce the cost, you could use a thermostat to bring on the system pumps when it's cold out.  Moving water doesn't freeze as easily as still water, and this is much more economical than having the heating come full on.  This will allow you to only bring the heating on when the risk of damage is high.  



It's also worth checking your frost arrangements are working - by seeing what happens in the autumn - and aren't doing anything unintended.  We found one frost setup in a modern church hall that had been keeping the building at 21C constantly for 10 years because it had been installed incorrectly.
