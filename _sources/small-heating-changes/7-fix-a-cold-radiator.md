If a radiator is cold and not heating a room enough, you or your installer may have turned up the boiler thermostat or increased the pump speed to compensate.  This isn’t as efficient or effective as finding out why the radiator is cold in the first place.  

- If the reason is sludge in the system, a powerflush should sort it.   

- If it is a faulty pump, then replacing the pump is a better option.  
- Sometimes the radiators just aren’t balanced so that radiator isn’t being supplied with sufficient hot water.  If you are patient and methodical, checking the balance is something you can do yourself, but you probably want to get a professional in to do the balancing, because it involves moving valve positions, and they’re best placed to fix the valve if it starts to leak.
