Heating controls in community buildings often waste a lot of energy.  Often they allow users to do things that will use energy beyond what they need to make themselves more comfortable – for instance, by turning on the heating permanently until someone else turns it off.  Sometimes they are just too difficult for users to understand, so they bring in space heaters, or they let one group do things that will make it impossible for the next group to get warm in time, like turn down a thermostat.  Understanding what is best for how you use your building is a key part of session 3.  

If you are using an old, analogue thermostat, just switching to a digital one will help.  They are more accurate and make users more comfortable by keeping the temperature from varying too much.  

Even if you have controls that suit your users, outdated controls can still waste energy.  Modern controls can predict when to turn the heating on to get a space to a given temperature by a given time, taking away the need to guess and change the timings when the weather changes.   Recent boilers can also vary their output so they put out less heat when it’s warm out, which is more efficient, but only if the boiler is used with a “compensation control” from the same manufacturer or they both use the OpenTherm standard.

<!-- :TODO:https://www.electricradiatorsdirect.co.uk/news/lot-20-explained-what-does-this-mean-for-electric-heating/ if a site has convective electric heating just with rocker switches, what can they do besides add countdown timers - is there any external control that can be wired in to control them better, or is the only way to improve efficiency to replace them with Lot-20 compliant controls? -->
