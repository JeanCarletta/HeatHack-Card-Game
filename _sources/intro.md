# Introduction  

This activity will  help groups explore a wide range of possible future measures that will improve the value they get from the energy use. The goal of the game is to help groups develop a shared understanding of what's right for their buildings and to choose a set of specific actions to explore and potentially build into their planning.  This makes it very different from, for instance, an energy efficiency survey.  

We call this a cooperative game, but there is no performance measurement - no one wins or loses (not even the whole group). This document explains how to use the cards and also gives explanations and further links for each of the cards in the set.  It's hard to explain some of the suggestions without linking to material from specific manufacturers.  Our links should not be taken to imply that we are endorsing any particular product or that it is the "best".  They are only meant to be illustrative.

```{admonition} Work in Progress

- Game introduction
- Small heating changes
- Big heating changes
- Actions we have deliberately excluded
