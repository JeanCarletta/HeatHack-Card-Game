Sometimes community groups are very keen on solar panels, but have difficult roofs.   Ground-mounting the panels is more expensive than on a normal roof, but bypasses that problem.  Some churches in North America are starting to put them in their grounds instead, for instance, in graveyards.  Sometimes the panels look a lot like the roof ones, and sometimes they are on mounted on poles.  Occasionally they are built into garden features.  It's important to think about flooding and vandalism if you are considering this option.
