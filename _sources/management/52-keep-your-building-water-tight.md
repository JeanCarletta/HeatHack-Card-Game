If buildings have to be extensively repaired or replaced, this has a huge carbon cost.  Just keeping a useful building going is a huge benefit.  Keeping a building water-tight will also make the occupants more comfortable, since damp makes them feel colder.

This means making sure the roof doesn't leak and keeping an eye on the gutters (in Scotland, "rhones"), downpipes, and gargoyles. They need regular maintenance to keep them clear of debris, and any hairline cracks can cause major problems if they aren't repaired.  Climate change means many buildings are already having to make changes to the sizes of their rainwater clearance devices to cope with heavier rainfall. 

It also means keeping the pointing on your building in good shape using the correct mortar.  Traditional buildings need breatheable lime mortar, not cement, to release moisture from the stone or brick, avoiding damp and damage to the stonework.

Finally, ou need sufficient ventilation in your building to clear the moisture generated by its users.  In traditional buildings, it's very common to find the ventilation features blocked up. Sometimes this is on purpose to stop heat loss and sometimes it's, for instance, leaf litter blocking air intakes at ground level on the outside of the building.  If you're having a problem with damp but are worried about the heat loss that comes with ventilation, also look at the ventilation and heat recovery extractor fan cards.
