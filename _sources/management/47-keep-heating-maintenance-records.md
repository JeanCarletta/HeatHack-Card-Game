It's very common in community buildings for the management to be unaware of just how often they are experiencing problems with their heating systems. When something breaks, they fix it and forget it. If you keep logs, you'll know what the problems are and your service providers will be able to come up with better solutions. For instance, if you need constant repairs to fix the pressure on your boiler, a log might help your installer to understand you need an external expansion vessel fitted, avoiding a new boiler. If you have constantly breaking TRVs, it will tell you they really aren't working for your users.
