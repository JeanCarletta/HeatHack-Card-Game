Everyone who can will want to make this replacement sooner or later - and the sooner, the better for the planet. The upfront costs are relatively high but if you can raise them, the running costs make it worth it.   Heat pumps take heat from the outside air or ground using the same kind of technology as refrigerators, but in reverse.  Ground source heat pumps are more expensive but take less energy to run than air source heat pumps because the ground is warmer.

How easy it is to make the change depends on the building. Ground source heat pumps are relatively expensive and require a reasonable amount of space to install - either several hundred square meters of land or access for drilling equipment that can lay pipes vertically. Air source heat pumps (ASHP) designed for commercial premises can also be very expensive. That means community buildings often need to install 2 or 3 domestic models, each about the size of a large suitcase, or to combine an ASHP with another source of heating, either temporarily or permanently. This is not practical in some buildings and can be inconvenient, although it does at least mean that if one breaks down there's still some heat.

The UK Government aspires to help industry make heat pumps cost the same as boilers by 2030.  In England and Wales, some non-domestic buildings qualify for grants to help towards the costs.  

For both types of heat pump, usually you will need to change to underfloor heating at the same time, so it's definitely a change that needs planned ahead.  Running your current system with a boiler flow temperature of 45C will give you some idea of whether you have generously enough sized radiators to install a heat pump or can just increase the radiator sizes without making other changes.  This is much more likely if you deal with heat loss first.
