# Replace your boiler with one that is hydrogen-ready

One way of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is to replace natural gas as a fuel with hydrogen.  Current (2022)"hydrogen-blend ready" boilers can tolerate up to 20% hydrogen mixed in with natural gas.  Sometime in the next few years, models will be able to accept 100% hydrogen either from the start or with an adaptation that is meant to cost around Â£100. 

Our problem with this is that no one knows how much carbon this will save.  The UK doesn't expect to decide what percentage of hydrogen will be in our future energy mix until 2026, much less how it will be generated.  Hydrogen can be generated either from fossil fuels or from electricity, but using electricity directly for heating is a lot more efficient.  If the UK decides to use hydrogen because it means less disruption for householders, it will need a lot more off-shore wind farms or nuclear power plants than it would otherwise. Until these big policy decisions are made, assuming that hydrogen is a green or lasting choice is a risky business.

We view this as a last resort option for groups whose boilers stop working, and better when boilers are available that can be adapted to pure hydrogen.
