# Replace your boiler with one that is hydrogen-ready

One way of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is to replace natural gas as a fuel with hydrogen.  Current "hydrogen-blend ready" boilers can tolerate up to 20% hydrogen mixed in with natural gas.  "Hydrogen-ready" boilers will be able to accept 100% hydrogen, either from the start or with work to adapt them later.  They should be available in the next few years.

No one knows how much carbon this will save.  The UK doesn't expect to decide what percentage of hydrogen will be in our future energy mix until 2026, much less how it will be generated.  Hydrogen can be generated either from fossil fuels or from electricity, assuming electricity is cheap and plentiful enough to use it for this purpose.  That makes it useful for energy resilience in a transition period, but it doesn't necessarily make it green.

We view this as a last resort option for groups whose boilers stop working.  If they commit to a hydrogen-blend ready boiler then if hydrogen takes off, there could be another major expense to come before that boiler reaches its natural end-of-life.
